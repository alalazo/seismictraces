     * @brief Models the Trace header of a SEGY file
     * 
     * According to SEGY rev 1 standard (May 2002):
     * 
     * > The SEG Y trace header contains trace attributes, which are defined as 
     * > two-byte or four-byte, two's complement integers. The values in bytes 
     * > 1-180 were defined in the 1975 standard and these entries remain 
     * > unchanged, although clarification and extensions may be supplied where 
     * > appropriate. Bytes 181-240 were for optional information in the 1975 
     * > standard and this has been the main area of conflict between different 
     * > flavors of SEG Y. This revision defines standard locations in bytes 
     * > 181-240 for certain values that are needed in modern data processing. 
     * > In particular, standard locations for a shotpoint number and ensemble 
     * > coordinates are defined. Bytes 203 to 210 allow the measurement units 
     * > for the Data Trace samples to be defined and transduction constants to 
     * > be defined. These entries allow the Data Trace values to be converted 
     * > to engineering units.
     * >
     * > The values included in the Trace Header are limited and intended to 
     * > provide information that may change on a trace-by-trace basis and the 
     * > basic information needed to process and identify the trace. The trace 
     * > headers are not intended to be a repository for significant amounts of 
     * > ancillary data. If significant amounts of ancillary data need to be 
     * > exchanged, it is recommended that SEG Ancillary Data Standard data 
     * > set(s) be used.
