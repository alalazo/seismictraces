     * @brief Models the Textual file header of a SEGY file
     * 
     * According to SEGY rev 1 standard (May 2002):
     * 
     * > The first 3200-byte, Textual File Header record contains 40 lines of 
     * > textual information, providing a human-readable description of the 
     * > seismic data in the SEG Y file.  This information is free form and is 
     * > the least well defined of the headers in the 1975 standard, although 
     * > the standard did provide a suggested layout for the first 20 lines.  
     * > While there would be distinct advantages in making the layout of this 
     * > header more rigid, it was decided that it would not be practicable to 
     * > produce a layout that would be universally acceptable in the light of 
     * > how it is currently used.
     * >
     * > The SEG Y rev 1 standard defines a separate textual header with a more 
     * > comprehensively defined structure, where textual information can be 
     * > stored in a machine-readable way.  This new header will be known as the
     * > Extended Textual File Header.
     * > Note that the “traditional” Textual File Header is completely separate 
     * > from the Extended Textual File Header and will still be the primary 
     * > location for human readable information about the contents of the file.
     * > In particular, it should contain information about any unusual features
     * > in the file, such as if the delay recording time in trace header 
     * > bytes 109-110 is non-zero.  The revision level of the SEG-Y format 
     * > (Binary File Header bytes 3501-3502) being used must be included for 
     * > all files written in the SEG Y rev 1 format.  
     * > It is mandatory that the SEG Y revision level be included in the 
     * > Textual File Header.
     * 
     * Technicalities apart, this class is a 40 x 80 table of characters with some 
     * additional checks to reveal non-conformity to the structure prescribed 
     * in the SEGY rev 1 standard.
     * 
     * The following is a small example of the basic use of the class:
     * @include example02.cpp
